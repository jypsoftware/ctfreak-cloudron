- Shell scripts (bash/powershell) on multiple servers concurrently via SSH
- SQL scripts on multiple databases concurrently (mysql/mariadb/postgresql)

Some use cases include:

- Replacing the crontabs on all your servers
- Trigger script execution from your mobile device through a nice and responsive web app
- Regularly checking if your website is still up
- Being notified on failed backups
- Coordinating the execution of distributed intensive computations across multiple servers
